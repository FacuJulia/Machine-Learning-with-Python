# Machine-Learning-with-Python

In this repository you will find some of the practical applications that were seen in the FreeCodeCamp course.

I used the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks.
I learned the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.
I explored more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.
